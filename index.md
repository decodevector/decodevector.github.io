## Who are we?

DecodeVector is an independent group of problem solvers. We intend to explore and understand the nature of computation to design efficient algorithms. We engage in mathematics, logic, science and other formal concepts as long as the motivation is drawn from the field of computing.

## What do we do?

We focus on theoretical computer science, or TCS, which is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more mathematical topics of computing and includes the theory of computation. It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The ACM's Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) provides the following description:

“TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.”

## Join our group

We're always looking for more members to join us - to help beginners to introduce to the field of computation and expand their analytical capabilities to design better algorithms, and eventually build a community of thinkers and solvers who can fluently look through this lens of computation.

To be able to help you with starting TCS, it is essential that you come with the following prerequisites. Apart from these, you're expected to have an inclination for Mathematics and self-motivated to put in efforts at DV.
